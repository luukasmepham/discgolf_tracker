**Disc Golf Tracker - Full Stack Development with Python**

This project is a disc golf score tracker application built with the intention of learning full-stack development using a practical and fun application. It utilizes a combination of Python libraries and frameworks to create a user-friendly experience for tracking disc golf scores and statistics.

**Technologies Used**
Backend:
  Python: Core programming language
  Flask: Web framework for building the API
  MySQL: Relational database for storing disc golf data
  
Frontend: (Future Implementation)
  A frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue.js) will be chosen later.
  
Testing: (Future Implementation)
  pytest: Unit and integration testing for Python code
  Robot Framework: Acceptance testing for overall application functionality
  
CI/CD: (Future Implementation)
  A CI/CD pipeline will be established to automate builds, testing, and deployment.
  
**Learning Objectives**
This project aims to provide a comprehensive learning experience for full-stack development by:
  Backend Development: Building and structuring a RESTful API using Flask.
  Database Management: Working with MySQL to store and retrieve disc golf data.
  Frontend Integration: Integrating a chosen frontend framework for user interaction (future implementation).
  Testing: Implementing unit, integration, and acceptance testing with pytest and Robot Framework.
  CI/CD Pipeline: Setting up a CI/CD pipeline for automated builds, testing, and deployment (future implementation)
